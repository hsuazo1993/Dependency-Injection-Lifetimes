**Dependency Injection Lifetimes**

In dependency injection, lifetimes determine how long an instance of a service lives within your application. This affects how instances are created, shared, and disposed of. There are three main lifetimes:

*   **Transient:** A new instance of the service is created every time it's requested. This is like having a large supply of light bulbs – every time you need one, you grab a brand new one, use it, and throw it away.
*   **Scoped:** A single instance of the service is created per scope. In a web application, a scope is typically an HTTP request. This is like having one light bulb per room in a house – each room has its own light bulb, and you use that specific bulb when you're in that room.
*   **Singleton:** A single instance of the service is created for the entire lifetime of the application. This is like having only one light bulb in the whole house – everyone uses the same bulb.

**Explanation of the Example**

The code you provided demonstrates these lifetimes using a `LightBulb` class and a console application.

*   **Transient:** In the Transient section, `UseTransientLightBulb` is called four times. Each time, a new `LightBulb` instance is created because it's registered as Transient. This is evident from the different GUIDs printed in the output.
*   **Scoped:** In the Scoped section, `UseScopedLightBulb` is called twice, once for "Bedroom 1" and once for "Bedroom 2". Each call creates a new scope. Within each scope, the same `LightBulb` instance is used (as seen by the same GUID), but different scopes have different instances.
*   **Singleton:** In the Singleton section, `UseSingletonLightBulb` is called twice. Since the `LightBulb` is registered as a Singleton, the same instance is used for both calls, resulting in the same GUID in the output.

**Example Output Analysis**

The output you provided confirms the correct behavior of each lifetime:

*   Transient: Each call to `UseTransientLightBulb` results in a new GUID, indicating a new `LightBulb` instance.
*   Scoped: Each call to `UseScopedLightBulb` with a different room name results in a new GUID, indicating a new `LightBulb` instance for each scope (room).
*   Singleton: Both calls to `UseSingletonLightBulb` result in the same GUID, indicating that the same `LightBulb` instance is used throughout the application.

This example effectively demonstrates how dependency injection lifetimes control the creation and sharing of objects within an application. By understanding these lifetimes, you can make informed decisions about how to manage your services and their dependencies, leading to more maintainable and efficient code.
